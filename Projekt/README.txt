MATLAB solution for the project in FHLF01 (Lukas Gardberg)

The solutions to the three different parts are split into three scripts,
part 1, 2, and 3.

part1.m - Stationary heat flow
part2.m - Transient heat flow
part3.m - Stresses and strains

additional files:

mesh1grov.m - initial rough mesh
pet1grov.mat - data from rough mesh
pet2med.mat - data from fine mesh

constants.mat - contants relevant constants for all three parts.

calc_mises.m - Help function which calculates the von Mises stress
calc_dstrain.m - Help function which calculates the D strain matrix.
